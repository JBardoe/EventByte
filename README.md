# EventByte
This is a event management website that allows for several user accounts as well as one superuser who acts as an admin. 

The website allows for the creation, management, cancellation, and uncancellation of events. 

### Users
It requires users to create an account and verify their email to access the site but does allow for password resetting as well. 
Users will receive notifications via email and are able to upload a profile picture.


Users are able to view and register for an event and will be issued a ticket they are able to cancel. Users that are registered for an event will receive a notification if there is a 
change to that event. Warnings are issued surrounding full, cancelled or near capacity events. Users are able to opt out of notifications if needed. 

### Super-User
The super user has complete control over the site and receives a log of all actions. The super can also edit event details and reset the database if required.
